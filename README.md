# TTS: Week 05, Day 05.

## PrimeLab.
**Challenge 1:**

Write a Java program to print out all the prime numbers between 1 and 100.

**Challenge 2:**

Students who enter college in a year that is a prime number and graduate, four years later, in a year that is also a prime number are considered in a Prime Class.
For example, the class of 1997 is a Prime Class as both 1993 and 1997 are prime numbers.
Write a program to compute and print out all the prime classes between 1900 and 2100.

**Required:** Write and use a method **isPrime()** to tell if a number is prime or not.

## PetLab.
Create a Pet Class with the following instance variables:

- name (PRIVATE)
- age (PRIVATE)
- location (PRIVATE)
- type (PRIVATE)

Two constructors

- empty
- all attributes

Code to be able to access the following (Get Methods):

- name
- age
- type

Code to be able to change (Set Methods):

- name
- age
- location

**\<yourclassname>.java**

Create a Custom Class (anything you want (car, phone, holiday etc.)

Requirements:

- Minimum 3 private instance variables
- An empty constructor
- A constructor that uses only 2 of your three variables
- A constructor that uses all 3 of your instance variables
- Get methods for all 3 of your instance variables
- Set Methods for all 3 of your instance variables
- A method that returns a Boolean
- A method that returns a String

For example, if I created a Santa Custom Class, my code would look something like the attached Santa.java file.

EXTRA PRACTICE:

**calculator.java**

Create a Custom Class:

- Create a Java Calculator Class that does the following five commands:

  - An **add** method that takes in two integer numbers and adds them together the call to that method would look like this: **add(int num1, int num2)**
  - A **subtraction** method that takes in two integers and subtracts them from one another would look like this: **subtract( int num1, int num2)**
  - A **multiplication** method that takes in two integer numbers and multiplies them together the call to that method would look like this: multiply(int num1, int num2)
  - A **division** method that takes in two integer numbers and divides them the call to that method would look like this: divide(int num1, int num2)
  - A **square** method that takes in one integer and squares it: square(int num1, int num2)

- Create a MagicCalculator that inherits its basic functionality from your calculator and does the following functions:

- - Finds the square root of a number
  - Finds the sin (trigonometry) of a number. [Note: Feel free to use the MATH class]
  - Finds the cosine (trigonometry) of a number. [Note: Feel free to use the MATH class]
  - Finds the tangent (trigonometry) of a number. [Note: Feel free to use the MATH class]
  - Finds the factorial (!) of the number

**Challenge 2:**

Students who enter college in a year that is a prime number and graduate, four years later, in a year that is also a prime number are considered in a Prime Class.
For example, the class of 1997 is a Prime Class as both 1993 and 1997 are prime numbers.
Write a program to compute and print out all the prime classes between 1900 and 2100.

**Required:** Write and use a method **isPrime()** to tell if a number is prime or not.
